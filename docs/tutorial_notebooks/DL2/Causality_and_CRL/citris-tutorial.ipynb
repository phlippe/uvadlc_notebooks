    "Understanding the latent causal factors of a dynamical system from visual observations is a crucial step towards agents reasoning in complex environments. In this tutorial, we will have a closer look at CITRIS ([Lippe et al., 2022a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03169)), a variational autoencoder framework that learns causal representations from temporal sequences of images in which underlying causal factors have possibly been intervened upon. As shown in the figure below, CITRIS utilizes both temporal consistency and interventions (orange) in order to identify causal variables (blue) from an image sequence. In contrast to previous work in causal representation learning, CITRIS considers causal variables as potentially multidimensional vectors. Furthermore, by introducing a normalizing flow, CITRIS can be easily extended to leverage and disentangle representations obtained by already pretrained autoencoders.\n",

    "Over the last decades, machine learning has become one of the most prominent approaches in artificial intelligence. One major advantage of machine learning approaches over earlier AI paradigms is their ability to automatically learn useful features from high-dimensional observations. However, in doing so, machine learning methods generally only leverage statistical information in data, and not the causal process that underlies how that data was generated in the first place. Consequently, they often struggle to perform tasks that involve out-of-domain generalization and planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Causal inference, on the other hand, goes beyond the statistical description of data, and instead aims to reason about the effect of *interventions* in the system underlying the data. In order to perform such causal reasoning, it is required that the causal variables and their relations are provided beforehand. However, many real-world observations, such as objects in images, are not structured into such variables to begin with. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, an emerging field of research is *causal representation learning* (CRL), in which the task is to identify such causal variables including their relations from low-level data such as images or videos ([Schölkopf et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11107)). The central idea here is that a low-level observation $X$ is merely a view on the state of a causal system $C_1, \\ldots, C_n$:\n",

In CRL, we are then interested in approximating the inverse of $G$ (e.g. with a neural network) in order to map a low-level observation to high-level causal variables that are useful  for a set of downstream tasks of interest, as shown in the figure below.\n",

    "The setting in which CITRIS aims to identify causal variables is TempoRal Intervented Sequences (TRIS). In TRIS, we assume that the underlying latent causal process is a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) over a set of $K$ causal factors $(C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_K)$. In the corresponding causal graph $G = (V, E)$, each node $i \\in V$ is associated with the causal factor $C_i$, which can be scalar or vector-valued, and each edge $(i, j) \\in E$ represents a causal relation from $C_i$ to $C_j$: $C_i \\to C_j$. \n",
    "\n",
    "TRIS further assumes that each causal factor $C_i$ is instantiated at each time step $t$, denoted $C_i^t$, and its causal parents can only be causal factors at time $t - 1$. In other words, we assume that DBN resembles a temporal latent causal process with $K$ causal factors $(C_1^t, C_2^t, \\ldots, C_K^t)_{t=1}^T$ that change over time according to the temporal dynamics governed by the DBM. Crucially, in TRIS, some causal factors might have been intervened upon at each time step, and we have access to the corresponding intervention targets (but not the intervention values). We denote these intervention targets by the binary vector $I^t \\in \\{0, 1\\}^K$, whose $i$-th component is 1 if and only if the causal factor $C_i$ has been intervened upon at time $t$ (i.e., $C_i^t$ has been intervened upon).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that we never observe the causal factors $(C^t)_{t=1}^T$ in TRIS, and instead only have access to a temporal sequence of high-level observations $(X^t)_{t=1}^T$ along with the corresponding intervention targets $(I^t)_{t=2}^T$. Each high-level observation represents a noisy and entangled view of all causal factors. Formally, $X^t = h(C_1^t, C_2^t, \\ldots, C_K^t, E_o^t)$, where $E_o^t$ represents noise, and $h: \\mathcal{C} \\times \\mathcal{E} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{X}$ is a function from the causal factor space $\\mathcal{C}$ and the space of the noise variables $\\mathcal{E}$ to the observation space $\\mathcal{X}$.

    "In this tutorial, we have taken a closer look at CITRIS, a recent CRL method that learns causal variables from an image sequence with interventions. We first discussed what causal representation learning comprehends, and why this recently emerging field of research is exciting. We then described the causal setting in which we aim to identify unknown causal variables, before explaining how CITRIS works in greater detail. Our experiments highlighted that CITRIS can disentangle the causal factors relatively well in the setting of 3D-rendered objects, and showed how we can use such a causal representation to perform interventions in a high-dimensional image space. Overall, considering that causality has great potential to address existing gaps in ML methods with a statistical basis, we believe that it will play an increasingly important role in machine learning in the coming decade."

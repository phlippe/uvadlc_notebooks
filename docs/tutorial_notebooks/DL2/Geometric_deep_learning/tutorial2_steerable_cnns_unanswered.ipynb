The first time we introduced the *regular representation* for finite groups, we chose a basis where each axis is associated with a group element; the action of $G$ is realized in this basis by a permutation of all the axes. Here, instead, we defined a basis for the same vector space where $G$ acts indipendently on different subsets of the axes, i.e. the action of $G$ is a block-diagonal matrix (the direct sum of irreps). This is often a more convenient choice of basis as we will see later."

    "These are the mathematical tools used to formalize Steerable CNNs.\n",

    "In the second part of this tutorial, you learnt about *steerable feature fields* and *steerable CNNs*.\n",
    "In particular, the previously defined  Fourier transform allowed us to build a steerable CNN which is equivalent to a Group-Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) equivariant to translations and the continuous group $G=SO(2)$ of rotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our steerable CNNs, we mostly leveraged the *regular representation* of the group $G$, but the framework of steerable CNNs allows for a variety of representations.\n",

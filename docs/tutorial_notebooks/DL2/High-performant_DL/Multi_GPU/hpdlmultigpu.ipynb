    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Using multiple GPUs is a central part in scaling models to large datasets and obtain state of the art performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen that, to control multiple GPUs, we need to understand the concepts of distributed computing. The core problem in distributed computing is the communication between nodes, which requires synchronization. Luckily, we are equipped with very limited communication tools, that minimize the chance that problems arise (the specifics are outside the scope of this course, to get more insight into the possible issues, look into [concurrent programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing), race conditions, deadlocks, resource starvation, semaphores and barriers, and the book Operating Systems Internals and Design Principles)."

    "**Tutorial content**. To better understand the primitives of communication in a distributed environment, we will begin by looking at some very basic exercises where simple operations are performed. Then, we will look at a more realistic scenario, the computation of the loss in a one-layer classifier (*more* realistic, but still *very* simple). Finally, we will learn how to run full-scale training on multiple GPUs and multiple nodes using PyTorch Lightning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running the code\n",
    "The code in these cells is not meant to be run with this notebook. Instead, the files provided should be used in an environment where multiple GPUs are available. This step is not required (all the outputs and explanation of the code are available here), but highly encouraged, as getting familiar with these concepts, especially the more simple primitives, will help when more cryptic errors start appearing in big projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the scripts can be done, for example, on the GPU partition of the LISA cluster ([General Knowledge on how to use the cluster](https://servicedesk.surfsara.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/SURFsara+Knowledge+Base)). After getting access using `ssh` (use WSL on Windows), we can setup the conda environment, by using the `module` package to load the correct anaconda version and then creating the environment based on the `environment.yml` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To upload the code, the `rsync` command can be used (on single files, it is possible to do it on folders by adding the `-r` option):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "rsync file account@lisa-gpu.surfsara.nl:~/file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the Anaconda module can be loaded and the environment created using:\n",
    "```\n",
    "module load 2021\n",
    "module load Anaconda3/2021.05\n",
    "conda env create -f environment.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It will take some time to download the necessary packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main code to run is the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "srun  -p gpu_shared -n 1 --ntasks-per-node 1 --gpus 2 --cpus-per-task 2 -t 1:00:00 --pty /bin/bash\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where with `-p gpu_shared` we ask for the shared partition where there are GPUs available (other gpu partitions available are listed [here](https://servicedesk.surfsara.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Lisa+usage+and+accounting)), then, we specify that we will be running only 1 task in this node, we want 2 GPUs and we use 2 CPUs as well, for 1 hour. The run consists of executing the command `/bin/bash` which starts a bash console on the node that we have been assigned. This allows for input of the necessary commands. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once inside, we can activate the correct anaconda environment and start running the scripts. We need to make sure that both GPUs are exposed to the script, with the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python my_script.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For these examples we will make use of the straightforward interface provided by [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html), a good summary is available at the documentation page, where all the details of the functions are shown."

Is it more efficient to use a multiple of the number of cores that are processing the data in the GPU, or is the difference in performance negligible? You can investigate these topics through experimentation."

This avoids having two processes writing in the same file. In order to have the other process wait for the first one to download, a **barrier** is used. The working principle is very simple, when a barrier is reached in the code, the process waits for all other processes to also reach that point in the code. Here we see how this can be a very useful construct in parallel computing, all processes require the dataset to be downloaded before proceeding, so one of them starts the download, and all wait until it's done.\n",

This broadcast operation is performed asynchronously, to allow for the rank 0 GPU to start loading images before the rank 1 has received the weights.

The reduction and broadcast operations are maybe the most important ones, allowing for delivery of data to all nodes and to perform mathematical operations on the data present in all the nodes. \n",

    "We have seen how we can use these collectives to perform a calculation of the loss of a neural network, but the same can be extended to any type of parallelizable computation.\n",

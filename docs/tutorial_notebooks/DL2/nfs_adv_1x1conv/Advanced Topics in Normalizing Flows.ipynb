    "The [Glow](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03039), a flow-based generative model extends the previous invertible generative models, [NICE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8516) and [RealNVP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08803), and simplifies the architecture by replacing the reverse permutation operation on the channel ordering with **Invertible 1x1 Convolutions**. Glow is famous for being the one of the first flow-based models that works on high resolution images and enables manipulation in latent space. Let's have a look at the interactive [demonstration](https://openai.com/blog/glow/) from OpenAI.\n",

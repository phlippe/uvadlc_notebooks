    "In the following series of tutorials, we will explore different parallelism strategies for training large deep learning models. Our focus will be on three common parallelism strategies: data parallelism, pipeline parallelism, and tensor parallelism. Data parallelism, as the name suggests, focuses on parallelizing the data processing of the model. If we are given a very large batch, we divide the batch into smaller batches and distribute them across multiple devices. Each device will process a different batch of data in parallel. Afterwards, we will aggregate the results from each device to update the model. Data parallelism is the most common parallelism strategy used in deep learning and well supported in most frameworks. Thus, we will start with data parallelism in this tutorial. In later tutorials, we will explore pipeline and tensor parallelism which focus on parallelizing the computation of the model itself. A short overview of the three parallelism strategies is shown in the figure below.\n",

    "We will focus on implementing data parallelism in JAX, but a lot of the concepts can be easily transferred to other frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow. With distributed computing introduced in [Part 2.1](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/scaling/JAX/data_parallel_intro.html), we can now implement a simple data parallelism strategy to train a small neural network on multiple devices. We then discuss fully-sharded data parallelism (FSDP), which distributes the model parameters across multiple devices and reduces memory consumption (also known as part of the [ZeRO optimizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02054))."

    "In data parallelism, we aim to use our multiple devices to increase our batch size. Each device will hold the same model and parameters, and process a different batch of data in parallel. After processing the data and obtaining the gradients for each batch, we aggregate the gradients over the devices and update our model. The main advantage of data parallelism is that it is easy to implement and scales well with the number of devices, since the devices need to communicate only once per batch. However, the main disadvantage is that the model size is limited by the memory of a single device, which can be a bottleneck for very large models and we will discuss how to overcome this in the next section.\n",

Since the forward step and backward pass do not require any communication between devices, we can use the same function `accumulate_gradients` as for the single-device training and scan over smaller splits of the batch per device.

    "\n",
    "So far, we have implemented data parallelism where the model parameters are replicated across all devices. This is a simple and effective way to parallelize the training of a model. However, as the model size continues to grow, the memory consumption of the model parameters can become a bottleneck. For instance, if we have a model with 1 billion parameters and 8 devices, each device would need to hold the full 1 billion parameters. With each parameter being in float32 and using an optimizer like Adam with two additional float32 values per parameter (first- and second-order momentum), the model itself already takes up 12GB of the device memory. This can be a problem for devices with limited memory, like taking already half the memory of an A5000 GPU with 24GB. To overcome this, we can shard the model parameters across multiple devices. This is known as fully-sharded data parallelism (FSDP) and is part of the [ZeRO optimizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02054). In FSDP, each device holds a different part of the model parameters and their optimizer state. Before executing a layer or module, we communicate the respective parameters across devices such that we can process the data in parallel. In the backward pass, we communicate the gradients back to the respective devices and update the model. This way, we can significantly reduce the memory consumption of the model parameters and scale to very large models. The ZeRO optimizer further extends this concept by allowing for different stages of sharding, such as only sharding the optimizer state ($P_{os}$), sharding the gradients as well ($P_{os+g}$), or sharding the model parameters as well ($P_{os+g+p}$, FSDP). The figure below shows the different stages of ZeRO (figure credit: [Rajbhandari et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02054)). Here, $\\Psi$ represents the number of parameters in the model, and $K$ the number of bytes in the optimizer state per parameter. In the mixed precision training setup shown, we use bfloat16 for the model parameters (2 bytes) and the gradients (2 bytes), and float32 for the Adam optimizer state (8 bytes) with a float32 copy of the parameters (4 bytes). Thus, our memory is 16 bytes per parameter. By using different stages of ZeRO, we can reduce the memory consumption of the model parameters and optimizer state by up to $1/N_d$ where $N_d$ is the number of devices.\n",

We will also discuss the communication of the optimizer state and gradients in the backward pass.\n"

    "We start by sharding the model parameters across multiple devices. The strategy we follow is as follows:\n",
    "- During initialization, we create the full parameters on each device.\n",
    "- We then use `jax.lax.axis_index` to split the parameters across devices and only keep a shard of the parameters on each device.\n",
    "- We annotate the parameters with the sharding specification, so we know how to put the parameters back together in the forward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "For annotating the sharding specification of parameters, Flax provides a wrapper called `nn.Partitioned` ([docs](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/flax.linen/_autosummary/flax.linen.Partitioned.html)). This wrapper takes as input a parameter and a list of axis names, similar to the `PartitionSpec` we have seen before. We can then use the parameter as before, but can use the axis name specification to determine the communication needed between devices, the shard map specification, and more. Further, whenever we apply transformations on modules with partitioned parameters, e.g. vmap or scan, the partitioned parameters will be transformed accordingly and the annotated axis adjusted to the new shapes. From now on, we consider parameters to be either a `jax.Array` if fully replicated, or a `flax.linen.Partitioned` if sharded across devices. We create a small type annotation for this case below."

    "We now need to write a function that shards the parameters across devices for FSDP. We can take as input a PyTree of parameters and a mesh axis name, and determine for each parameter the sharding specification. To keep the global shape of a parameter untouched, we look for an axis which can be equally split across the number of devices present. If multiple are present, we select the largest possible axis, to keep the sharding consistent when varying the number of devices. We then use this axis as the sharding axis, and wrap the parameter in a `nn.Partitioned` with the axis name and position. For some parameters that are very small, sharding may not be beneficial since the communication time may outweigh the memory costs. For instance, we are likely interested in sharding large weight matrices while the bias and scaling parameter in a normalization layer have negligible memory costs. We can specify a minimum size for sharding, and only shard parameters that are larger than this size. We implement the function below:"

    "Another aspect in the design of FSDP is how we deal with the gathered parameters during the training step. If we use the function as is, we would gather the parameters and we keep the full parameters as intermediate arrays on a single device until the backward step is completed. We may have situations where the full parameters do not fit on a single device. In that case, we can remat the gather operation, such that after the forward pass of a module, we free up the memory of the full parameters of the module, and only keep the sharded parameters. We can then gather the parameters again before the backward pass, and scatter the gradients back to the respective devices. This can be done by using the `remat` transformation directly on `gather_params`, or by rematting the whole forward pass with a policy to remat all `all_gather` operations: `@partial(jax.remat, policy=lambda op, *_, **__: str(op) != 'all_gather')` (see [official documentation](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/autodiff_remat.html#custom-policies-for-what-s-saveable) for more details). The final option is to remat the whole module, which we have seen in the previous tutorial. In that case, it matters whether we shard the parameters of every individual module, or the global module, since in the individual case, we also remat the gather, while in the other case, we only remat the forward pass. All these options trade off memory and communication cost, and need to be chosen based on the hardware at hand. We will provide both options in our code, such that depending on the model size, the corresponding setup can be chosen.\n",

The partitioning is determined within the model initialization, so we cannot manually specify it as before. Instead, we can first wrap the initialization function with `shard_map` and an unknown output specification (i.e. simply set to all replicated `P()` and `check_rep` to False), and evaluate the shapes which is independent of the output specification. Since the shapes are also determined for the partitioned parameters, we can then use the shapes to determine the sharding specification. An easy way of doing that is by using `nn.get_partition_spec` which returns the sharding specification of a PyTree with `nn.Partitioned` leafs.

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we have introduced the basic building blocks of distributed computing in JAX, and implemented data parallelism and fully-sharded data parallelism. In data parallelism, we shard the input batch over the data axis, and the model parameters are replicated across all devices. This allows for a larger batch size and faster training. For large models, we further improved the memory footprint by sharding the model parameters across devices. In this fully-sharded data parallelism (FSDP), we have seen how to shard the model parameters, and how to gather and scatter the parameters and gradients in the forward and backward pass. Data parallelism is one of the most common parallelism strategies in deep learning, and FSDP is a powerful tool to scale to very large models. Still, we may come to situations where the model size is limited by the memory of a single device, and we need expensive remat strategies to overcome this. Alternatively, we can look at other parallelism strategies which shard the model execution itself over devices. These strategies, also called model parallelism, will be the focus in the next tutorials, specifically pipeline parallelism and tensor parallelism. With these, we can scale to even larger models and train billion-parameter models efficiently."

    "In this tutorial, we will discuss tensor parallelism, another important parallelism strategy for training large-scale deep learning models. Similar to pipeline parallelism, tensor parallelism is a model parallelism strategy, which means that it focuses on parallelizing the model itself, rather than the data. The key difference between pipeline and tensor parallelism is how they split the model over devices. In pipeline parallelism, the model is split over devices along the sequence of layers (i.e. vertically), while in tensor parallelism, the model is split over devices along the feature dimensions (i.e. horizontally). Each device will then process a different subset of features, and the model's forward and backward passes will be split over devices accordingly. A short overview of the parallelism strategies is shown below.\n",

    "\n",
    "Tensor parallelism can be applied on a per-module/per-layer basis. This gives more flexibility in how to split the model over devices than pipeline parallelism, and can even handle situations where a single layer is too big to fit on a single device. Furthermore, tensor parallelism does not suffer from the pipeline bubble problem, as all devices can work on the same batch of data at the same time. The key behind making tensor parallelism efficient will be, again, to overlap computation with communication, and to minimize the amount of communication required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, tensor parallelism relies on frequent communication between devices, such that it requires devices with high speed interconnects like TPUs or GPUs with [NVLink](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/nvlink/), and is often restricted to devices within a node. For example, [Gemini v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11805) was trained with model parallelism within a node (TPU superpod), but applies only data parallelism across nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will discuss the principles of tensor parallelism, and how to implement it in JAX. We will first start with an implementation on a simple MLP model. In [Part 4.2](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/scaling/JAX/tensor_parallel_async.html), we discuss techniques from models like the [ViT-22b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05442) to maximize efficiency of tensor parallelism with compute-communication overlaps. Finally, in [Part 4.3](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/scaling/JAX/tensor_parallel_transformer.html), we will discuss how to apply tensor parallelism to the transformer model specifically, and how to combine tensor parallelism with fully-sharded data parallelism."

    "## Tensor Parallelism for Linear Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "The key design principle behind tensor parallelism is to split the model over devices along the feature dimensions. For instance, consider a Transformer model with a hidden size of 1024, and we want to split the model over 4 devices. We would then split the hidden size over the devices, such that device 0 will process features 0-255, device 1 will process features 256-511, and so on. However, as we know from basic deep learning principles, the hidden dimensions are rarely independently processed. Thus, we need to design the model layers such that they communicate features or outputs between devices efficiently, whenever it is needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the most basic neural network operations, let's consider a matrix multiplication as we would do it in an MLP. We can write it as $Ax=y$, with $A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_y\\times d_x}$ being the weight matrix, $x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_x\\times B}$ the input (batch last for simplicity), and $y\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_y\\times B}$ the output. In tensor parallelism, each device will carry a subset of the input dimensions, e.g. $x$ is split into $x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3$ across devices. The goal is to end up with the same output $y$ as if we had computed it on a single device, but again partitioned across devices ($y_0, y_1, y_2, y_3$). This is visualized below.\n",

    "<center width=\"100%\" style=\"padding: 10px\"><img src=\"../figures/tensor_linear_basic_setup.svg\" width=\"800px\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is now how to split $A$ such that we can compute $y$ in a distributed manner. There are two main strategies we can follow are communicating the input (gather) or the output (scatter). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the **gather** strategy, we communicate the input $x$ to all devices, such that each device has the full $x$ (this communication type is called [all_gather](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.lax.all_gather.html)). Then, we can compute the output $y\\_i$ on each device $i$ independently by: $y_i = \\sum_{j} A_{i,j} x_j$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the **scatter** strategy, we compute the sub-result of each input $x_i$ on the output $y$ independently on each device: $y^{(i)}_j=A_{i,j}x_{i}$. Afterwards, we communicate the results across devices and sum the needed result on each device: $y_i = \\sum_{j} y^{(j)}_i$. This communication type is called [(psum) scatter](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.lax.psum_scatter.html#jax.lax.psum_scatter).\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the weight matrix $A$, the two strategies differ in that the gather strategy splits the rows of $A$ across devices, while the scatter strategy splits the columns of $A$ across devices. We visualize the two strategies below (for simplicity, the communication is not explicitly visualized).\n",
    "\n",
    "<center width=\"100%\" style=\"padding: 10px\"><img src=\"../figures/tensor_linear_gather_scatter.svg\" width=\"800px\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the two strategies is more efficient depends on the size of the input and output dimensions. In general, we want to communicate as little data as possible, and thus the gather strategy is more efficient if the input dimension is much larger than the output dimension, and vice versa. Since the dimensions will be different for each layer, we will need to decide on a per-layer basis which strategy to use. For example, in an MLP block of a Transformer where we expand the hidden dimension by 4x, we will want to use the gather strategy for the first linear layer, and the scatter strategy for the second linear layer. This way, we avoid communicating the large hidden dimensionality."

    "Let's now implement the two strategies in JAX. In the gather strategy, each device will hold $A_{i,:}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_y/4\\times d_x}$ of the weight matrix, and in the scatter strategy, each device will hold $A_{:,i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d_y\\times d_x/4}$ of the weight matrix. This raises a small difficulty during initialization. Many initialization strategies depend on the shape of the full weight matrix, and we need to adjust them to the shape of the split weight matrix. As a simple trick, we will implement a wrapper around the init function that will scale the values by a specified constant. We then leave it up the user to adjust the constant such that the initialization is appropriate for the split weight matrix. For instance, if we use a fan-in initialization (e.g. [He initialization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01852)), we would scale the initialization by $\\sqrt{1/\\text{num}\\_\\text{devices}}$ for the scatter strategy to adjust for the $1/\\text{num}\\_\\text{devices}$ smaller input dimension. For the gather strategy, we would not need to scale the initialization, since all devices will process the full input dimension. For more details on network initialization, see our [initialization tutorial](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/JAX/tutorial4/Optimization_and_Initialization.html). As an alternative, we could implement our own initializer functions that directly take into account the split weight matrix dimensions (which may be tedious to support all initializations), or initialize the full weight matrix on each device and then split it. However, the latter would be less efficient and would potentially even fail if the weight matrix is too large to fit on a single device."

The `TPDense` module will then split the weight matrix over the devices, and implement the gather and scatter strategies for the forward and backward passes. For some layers, we may need to implement custom communications. For instance, the very first layer of the model may already have the input gather over devices, since we can prefetch the batch from the host to all devices. Similarly, in the last layer of the module, we may not want to scatter the output, but rather gather it to a single device to compute the loss.

    "Finally, we combine the MLP blocks with an input and output layer. We expect that the input to the model is duplicated over model devices and thus does not need to be gathered anymore. This is likely the best case for the input processing as well, since the batch can already be prefetched to all devices and we may not be able to split the input over model devices equally (e.g. text may be only single integers, so that we cannot split it over feature dimensions). If working with a mesh where the model axis goes across processes, we may want to split the input over model devices on the batch dimension as well, and gather it before applying the model. This ensures all model devices will start with the same input.\n",

    "The output layer will be a linear layer with the number of classes as output dimensions. We will wrap this layer in a `TPDense` module with the scatter strategy, but we will not scatter the output. Instead, to compute the loss, a device needs to have the full output features. Hence, we apply a `jax.lax.psum` to sum the final output over devices. Note that this gives all model devices the same tensor, and thus the same loss. We may want to then only calculate the loss on a single device, and broadcast it back to all devices via the `psum` operation. For models with large output sizes, this might be inefficient since a single device needs to be able to hold the entire output. For simplicity, we will ignore this for now here, but address it in the transformer model later. Finally, as usual, we convert the output to float32 to avoid numerical issues in the loss computation."

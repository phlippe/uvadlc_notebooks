    "In [Part 3.1](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/scaling/JAX/pipeline_parallel_simple.html), we have seen how we can use pipeline parallelism to distribute a model across multiple GPUs. A remaining difficulty in pipeline parallelism is the pipeline bubble, which is the time that devices are idle while waiting for the next stage to finish. Micro-batching, as discussed in [Part 3.1](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/scaling/JAX/pipeline_parallel_simple.html), improves the efficiency of pipeline parallelism, but some drawbacks still remain. For example, while the pipeline bubble has been reduced, our devices are still idle for `model_axis_size - 1` stage executions of a single microbatch. One way of reducing this idle time is by making the microbatches smaller and execute more in sequence, but as discussed before, it becomes difficult to fully utilize the devices with tiny batch sizes. So, can we instead reduce the time of the second factor, i.e. the stage execution? As it turns out, we can, and one option for it are *Looping Pipelines* introduced by [Narayanan et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04473), which will be the focus of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have split the model into consecutive stages of layers. For instance, for a model with 8 layers and 4 model devices, we would place the first two layers on the first device, the next two layers on the second device, and so on. However, we can also split the model into non-consecutive stages, and *loop* over our devices. For instance, we could place the first layer on the first device, the second layer on the second device, and so on, until we place the fifth layer on the first device again. This split of layers is shown in the figure below.\n",

    "\n",
    "A microbatch is then passed through the looped pipeline in a similar way as before, but the output of the last stage, when it executes layer 4, is passed to the first stage again to continue with layer 5. Now, every stage execution takes only have the time as before, since we are executing half the layers. Furthermore, compared to reducing microbatch size, the stage reduction doesn't reduce efficiency since the layers would have been executed sequentially anyways.\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as we have more or an equal number of microbatches as number of model devices, which we anyways need to keep the pipeline efficient, we can keep the devices busy for a large amount of the time. This is because the output of the first stage is passed to the second stage, and so on, until the output of the last stage is passed to the first stage again. This way, the looping does not introduce an additional bubble while reducing the execution of the individual stages. The computation graph for the forward pass will look similar as in the figure below: \n",

    "<center width=\"100%\" style=\"padding: 10px\"><img src=\"../figures/pipeline_looping.svg\" width=\"800px\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if we have more microbatches than model devices, we can either decide to first finish all microbatches of its earlier layer before moving on to the next layer (breadth-first), or start with the next layer as early as possible (depth-first). We will discuss the differences between the two approaches below, but support both in our implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to the estimated execution time of the original pipeline (shown in gray), the execution time of the looping pipeline is significantly reduced, and the devices are kept busy for a larger portion of the time. We have to note though, that this computation graph takes a strong simplification by ignoring the communication costs, which we discuss in more detail in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will implement a looping pipeline for a simple model and compare it to the original pipeline. We will also discuss the differences between the depth-first and breadth-first approaches, and how we can implement them."

    "### Importance of Communication Overlap\n",
    "\n",
    "Looping pipelines reduce the pipeline bubble, but for the cost of increased communication overhead. Consider `num_loops` to be the number of separate layers per stage (a standard pipeline has `num_loops=1`). For a single microbatch, a standard pipeline requires `model_axis_size - 1` communications (i.e. once between each stage pair), while a looping pipeline requires `model_axis_size * num_loops - 1` communications (i.e. multiple loops over each stage pair). Many frameworks like JAX support asynchronous communication, which means that the communication can overlap with the computation. However, this is only possible if the computation does not depend on the communicated values. For instance, if the output of stage 1 is communicated to stage 2, stage 2 may not be able to start its computation before the communication is finished (if there are computations that are independent of the input, e.g. RoPE embeddings, they can be executed in parallel). Meanwhile, if stage 1 may not have to wait for stage 4 to finish its computation if it uses the original input and is not yet in the looping regime. Thus, while the looping pipeline seems always superior over the non-looping version in ideal conditions, we may not be able to ignore the communication cost in practice and need to take them into account. An example comparison of GPU utilization between (a) no communication cost versus (b) common communication cost is shown below (figure credit:[Joel Lamy-Poirier, 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.05953.pdf)). We will have a closer discussion on this in the next notebook on tensor parallelism.\n",

    "Pipeline parallelism is usually combined with data parallelism to further increase the global batch size. This adds another layer of communication, since after having calculated the gradients for a stage, we need to communicate them across data devices. From our previous discussion, we know that overlapping communication with computation is crucial for efficient distributed training. In standard pipelines, we can only start communicating the gradients after the last microbatch per stage has finished. Depending on the communication cost, this can lead to a significant idle time of the devices, as shown in the computation diagram below (figure credit:[Joel Lamy-Poirier, 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.05953.pdf)).\n",

    "\n",
    "In looping pipelines, we can instead structure our layer execution such that we can start communicating gradients earlier. For instance, the breadth-first strategy ([Joel Lamy-Poirier, 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.05953.pdf)) follows the setup that each stage first finishes all microbatches of its earlier layer before moving on to the next layer. This way, in the backward pass, we finish calculating all gradients for the later layers before having done the computation of the earlier layers. This allows us to start communicating the gradients of the later layers earlier, and overlap it with the computation of the gradients of the early layers. The final communication of the earlier layers will be cheaper than the non-looped version, since significantly fewer gradients need to be communicated (specifically `1/num_loops`). The computation diagram for the backward pass of the breadth-first strategy is shown above. An alternative strategy is the depth-first strategy, which starts with the next layer as early as possible, but cannot take advantage of the early communication of the gradients as well as the breadth-first strategy. While we will mainly focus on the breadth-first strategy, our implementation is designed to support both strategies."

This is because the current implementation needs to stack the parameters over the looping axis within the pipeline, in order to support the SPMD jitting of the pipeline. Thus, the gradients are only communicated once the gradients for all parameters in the pipeline have been calculated. To keep the implementation simple, we will neglect the asynchronous gradient communication for now, and focus on the forward pass of the pipeline. A future version of the implementation may support asynchronous gradient communication once we find a simple way for it, and we will update the notebook accordingly.\n",

    "### Looping Pipeline Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's focus now on the implementation of looping pipelines. Compared to the non-looped pipeline, we need to take care of two additional aspects: (1) the looping communication between the last and first stage, and (2) the execution of different layers on a single device over iterations. We will start with the first aspect, and then discuss the second aspect.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we had the same number of microbatches as model devices, the communication between the last stage and the first stage would not be any different from the communication between any other stage pair after we processed the original input batches. However, if we have more microbatches than model devices, we will need to buffer the outputs of the last stage until we have processed all microbatches of the earlier layers, since the first stage is not ready to process the output of the last stage yet. Thus, at each iteration, we need to check on device 0 which microbatch the communicated features of the last stage belong to and buffer accordingly. We can do this by simply determining the index of the microbatch by using the iteration index, and overwrite the respectively indexed subarray `inputs` of the first stage with the buffered features. For example, with four devices, the last stage will process the first microbatch at iteration 3 (zero-indexed). At the subsequent communication, we overwrite `inputs[0]` on device 0 with the communicated features from the last stage. We can then continue with the execution of the first stage as usual and continue iterating over the input array. This results in a computation graph similar to the one shown below (we show processing of 6 instead of 4 microbatches to visualize the buffering mechanism).\n",

    "The second aspect we need to take care of are the different layers we need to execute at different iterations. Note that these layer indices are not the same across stages: in the diagram above, the first stage will have to switch from layer 0 to layer 4 earlier than the last stage from layer 3 to 7. We can handle this by using the iteration index to determine the layer index we need to execute, and pass the sub-indexed parameters of the respective layer to the stage. \n",
    "\n",
    "To keep our implementation as general as possible, we will explicitly pass these \"switching\" indices to the pipeline function. For this, we implement a `PipelineState` below, which contains:\n",
    "* `inputs`: The input array, which is the original input array at the first iteration, and is used as buffer for the output of the last stage in subsequent loops.\n",
    "* `outputs`: The output array, which will store the output of the final layer of the last stage.\n",
    "* `input_indices`: The indices indicating which microbatch to process at each iteration on the first stage.\n",
    "* `output_indices`: The indices indicating into which output array to write the output of the last stage at each iteration. If -1, the features will not be stored in the `outputs` array.\n",

    "The first device iterates over its input array as in a standard pipeline. Once the end is reached, it loops back to the first microbatch. At this point, the array will have been updated (seen by the `update_indices` being 0 at step 3) and contain the output features of the first microbatch after layer 2 on stage 2. In terms of the parameter indices, the first stage executes four times layer 0 (iterates over the four input microbatches), and then switches to layer 3. For the last two steps, we can arbitrarily select the layer since the output is not used anymore.\n",

The last four microbatches are processed by the final layer and hence stored in the output array. The parameter indices are shifted by two in comparison to the first device, since it needs to wait for the first and second device to process the microbatches by the first and second layer, respectively.\n",

In comparison to the previous implementation, we do not use a `nn.scan` operation since we need to handle the parameter indices explicitly. This is because we need multiple parameters for the same module, but fewer than the number of iterations and each device using different parameters at different iterations. Instead, we use a `jax.lax.fori_loop` operation, which allows us to handle the parameter indices explicitly. We also need to handle the RNGs explicitly, since we cannot arbitrarily mix JAX and Flax transformations. After finishing the loop, we reshape the output back to the original shape, and return the reshaped output."

    "## Profiling\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now profile the model to see if the looping pipeline is more efficient than the non-looped pipeline. For simplicity, we use the MLP classifier in this notebook and scale it up to 16 layers with 2048 hidden size and mlp expansion of 4, and 8 microbatches. We distribute the model over one node with 8 A5000 GPUs, and use a model axis size of 2. Every pair of GPUs in the model axis are connected via 4 NVLink connections with a measured communication speed of 60GB/s in each direction. All other devices are connected via the PCIe bus, such that larger pipeline sizes would lead to a significant increase in communication cost. In general, we use the profiling to verify the working of the pipeline, and not to measure the absolute performance of the pipeline. All traces are uploaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iz8XpnZOtscpWiYz3AhsLUs02n9fNDIp/view?usp=sharing). \n",
    "\n",
    "We first show the trace for the non-looped pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center width=\"100%\" style=\"padding: 10px\"><img src=\"../figures/pipeline_plain_trace.png\" width=\"1000px\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to the previous networks, we see many small operations and scans, which are difficult to see all from the image above. If you want to dive deeper into the trace, you can download the trace and open it in TensorBoard. We find the expected pattern of the forward pass being an outer loop of 9 steps (8 microbatches + 1 pipeline shift slot), and each step containing the execution of the 8 layers per stage with communication. The backward pass is similar with 9 outer steps and 8 inner steps. Although the communication is not overlapped with the computation, the communication between stages only takes 17$\\mu{}s$ compared to 5ms of a single stage forward pass. Where a lot of time is lost, though, is in the gradient synchronization after the backward pass. Since the gradients only finish computing in the last microbatch step, we need to wait almost until the end before we can start communicating the gradients. This is a significant bottleneck in the non-looped pipeline, especially on hardware with high communication costs over the data axis. We also note that in Transformer models, we would see a slightly different pattern, since the activations are significantly larger (additional sequence length) and reduce the relative communication cost of the gradients. Further, we find a significant amount of time is spent in the `dynamic_slice_update` operation of the inner `scan` operation over layers, which suggests that we may get a significant speedup by removing the scan as in the single-GPU setup.\n",

    "\n",
    "This trace has even more small operations, which we need to zoom in to see. We find the expected pattern of the forward pass being an outer loop of $8 * 8 + 1=65$ steps, and each step containing the execution of only 1 layer. The backward pass is similar with 65 outer steps and 1 inner step. The communication again makes up only a small fraction of the total time, and the compiler overlaps the time with the `scan` operation computation. Still, we find a similar bottleneck in the gradient synchronization after the backward pass, which, in theory, the looping pipeline should be able to reduce. This is because the current implementation needs to stack the parameters over the looping axis within the pipeline, in order to support the SPMD jitting of the pipeline. Thus, the gradients are only communicated once the gradients for all parameters in the pipeline have been calculated. To obtain the maximum efficiency of the pipeline, we would need to support asynchronous gradient communication, which is left for future times. Nonetheless, already in its current version, the looping pipeline is 7% faster, taking 190ms for a full forward and backward pass versus 205ms for the non-looped pipeline."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we have discussed and implemented pipeline parallelism with micro-batching and looping pipelines. The main challenge of pipelines remains the pipeline bubble, which can reduce their efficiency. While looping pipelines and other strategies can improve its efficiency, we usually have to trade-off communication cost and computation time. Hence, the best trade-off depends on the specific model and hardware setup. We have also shown how to combine pipeline parallelism with data parallelism, and how to test the pipeline parallelism by comparing the outputs of the non-parallelized and parallelized model. For simplicity, we have not applied full sharding data parallelism, but the same principles apply and can be implemented without changes to the pipeline wrapper. We will show that in the final notebook on 3D parallelism. In the next notebook, we will discuss tensor parallelism, which is another strategy to parallelize the model across multiple devices."

    "In [Part 4.1](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/scaling/JAX/tensor_parallel_simple.html), we implemented a parallel linear layer using tensor parallelism. However, our implementation has one major inefficiency. In the gather strategy, we first need to communicate the features over all devices before we can compute the output. This means that all devices are idle until we finish the communication, and we do not overlap communication with computation. Similarly, in the scatter strategy, we first need to compute the output on all devices before we can communicate the results and sum them. This means that all devices are busy until we finish the computation, and then need to wait for the communication to finish before continuing with subsequent layers. This is a major inefficiency, and we would like to avoid it if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tackle this challenge, we will implement asynchronous linear layers in this notebook. Using an asynchronous gather and scatter strategy, we will overlap communication with computation, which will allow us to hide the communication latency and improve the overall performance of our model. The techniques we will use in this notebook are inspired by the [ViT-22b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05442) model, which used these techniques to scale up Vision Transformers. In [Part 4.3](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/scaling/JAX/tensor_parallel_transformer.html), we will apply these techniques to scale up our Transformer-based language model."

    "## Tensor Parallelism with Compute-Communication Overlap\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook on pipeline parallelism, we discussed how one can overlap communication with computation by sending sub-results as soon as they become available. We can apply the same principle to tensor parallelism. At the start of the linear layer, each device has a subset of the input features. We can directly start computing the output with respect to these features, which corresponds to $A_{i,i}x_{i}$ in our original notation. While we do that, we can already communicate the features to the next device, such that we overlap communication with computation. As soon as the next device receives the features, it can start computing the output with respect to these features, and continue the process. This way, we save the time of waiting for the communication to finish before we can start computing the output, and we improve the efficiency of the model, closer to the theoretical maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can implement this strategy, we need to have a way of performing the communication efficiently and asynchronously with respect to the computation. In JAX, we can do this with `jax.lax.ppermute`, which is a parallel permutation operation and we have seen in previous notebooks before. It allows us to send an array to the next device in a ring topology, and receive an array from the previous device. As long as we do not try to access the array before it has been fully communicated, we can continue with the computation and overlap communication with computation. We will use this operation to implement an asynchronous version of our gather and scatter-sum operations."

    "### Async Gather\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with the gather strategy. Each device holds a subset of the input features, and we want to communicate the input features asynchronously to all devices. We start by performing a `jax.lax.ppermute` to send the current features to the next device in our ring topology. This means device 0 sends the features to device 1, device 1 sends the features to device 2, and so on, until the last device sends its features to device 0. However, instead of concatenating the communicated features with the current features, as we would get with `jax.lax.all_gather`, we collect the communicated arrays in a list. This way, the features present on the device and the communicated features become two independent arrays, on which we can perform independent operations. For instance, we could already start computing the output with respect to the current features, while waiting for the communication to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, each device has its own features and those of its neighbor. However, we want all features to be gathered on all devices. We achieve this by communicating the newly communicated features to the next device as soon as they become available. For example, device 0 sends the communicated features from device 3 to device 1, device 1 sends the communicated features from device 0 to device 2, and so on. By continuining this pattern, we can ensure that all devices have all features by using the minimal amount of communication (each device only sends and receives $N-1$ features, where $N$ is the number of devices). \n",
    "\n",
    "The communication pattern is visualized below. The first column shows the initial features on each device, and each block represents the list of features per device. The second column shows the communicated features after a single `jax.lax.ppermute`, and so on. The arrows indicate the communication pattern.\n",

    "<center width=\"100%\" style=\"padding: 10px\"><img src=\"../figures/tensor_async_gather.svg\" width=\"1000px\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "We note that in contrast to the all-gather operation, each device ends up with a different order of the features. This is not a problem for our purposes, since our final operation of performing a matrix multiplication with the weight matrix is independent of the order of the features. We will sum the outputs of each feature and learn the weight matrix from scratch, thus being able to handle the different order of the features. Still, one should keep in mind that this might lead to a different weight matrix order than in the all-gather operation, and converting between the two operations requires a permutation of the weight matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now implement the async gather strategy below. In implementation, we can decide which direction of the ring we communicate along (device 0 to device 1, or device 1 to device 0). More on this later. We further write the implementation general enough such that it also supports PyTree's that we need to communicate across devices. This becomes helpful when we have a more complex model, and the module's input or output is a PyTree."

If we have an even number of devices, the last communication cycle will be unidirectional again since we require an uneven amount of communication cycles. An alternative bidirectional communication strategy that overcomes this inefficiency is to split the features over the hidden dimension, and communicate half in one direction and half in the other direction. This way, we can ensure that we always communicate in both directions, and may speed up the latency of the first feature to be communicated, since the features are smaller. However, this strategy requires more communication cycles and may require operations on smaller arrays, which may have a lower utilization of the devices depending on the feature and operation size. Additionally, it gives a strictly different list structure of the features than the unidirectional version. We implement this strategy below."

In scatter, we have the opposite situation than in gather: all inputs are already available at the start of the operation, and instead, we want to communicate the output to all devices. Thus, we want to start communicating as soon as we have computed a part of the output needed on another device. The asynchronous scatter strategy is visualized below.\n",

    "As input, we have the full output features on each device. For clarity, we denote the arrays as $a_0,...,a_3$ for device 0 and so on, where $a_i$ corresponds to $y^{(0)}_i$ in our earlier notation. Note that not all arrays need to be ready at this point, and mainly start with a list of arrays to indicate the computation graph to the compiler. In eager mode, this can correspond to the setup where the CPU offloaded the computation of the array to the GPU, but can already continue with the next operation until the values of the array are needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first step, we communicate the first outputs of all devices in a round robin fashion. This communication can be performed as soon as $a_0$, $b_0$, $c_0$, and $d_0$ are available (highlighted in red), and will be overlapped with the computation of $a_1$, $b_1$, $c_1$, and $d_1$. The communicated arrays will then be added to the output arrays $a_1$, $b_1$, $c_1$, and $d_1$ as soon as they become available, and we start the next round of communication. This round overlaps with the computation of $a_2$, $b_2$, $c_2$, and $d_2$, and so on. This way, we can overlap communication with computation and improve the efficiency of the model. The final output on each device will be the sum of some output part of all devices, which follows the scatter pattern. However, in comparison to the non-async scatter, the order of the output parts will be different: device 0 has the sum $a_3+b_0+c_1+d_2$, while in the non-async scatter, it would have been $a_0+b_0+c_0+d_0$. As for the async gather operation, this is usually not a problem, since the order of the output parts is not important for the learned linear layer.\n",

    "Now, let's use these asynchronous linear layers to improve the efficiency of our MLP blocks. We will implement the same MLP block as before, but replace the `TPDense` layers with `TPAsyncDense` layers. We will use the gather strategy for the first linear layer, and the scatter strategy for the second linear layer. For the input layer, we also need to adjust the initialization by scaling the values by $\\sqrt{1/\\text{num}\\_\\text{devices}}$, since the input to each layer will be $1/\\text{num}\\_\\text{devices}$ of the full feature size.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the splitting of the dense layer into multiple smaller layers works without problems, we also need to apply other layers in the same way. For instance, the activation function can be applied independently on each input, such that we do not need to adjust for it. However, the normalization layer commonly contains statistics that are computed over the full feature size, and we cannot do it anymore within the input layer (in the non-async implementation, the gather strategy allowed for it). Instead, we first apply the normalization layer and compute the statistics across devices. Luckily, in Flax, this is already supported by passing an `axis_name` to the normalization layer (see e.g. the docs for [RMSNorm](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/flax.linen/_autosummary/flax.linen.RMSNorm.html)). We only need to wrap it in a model parallelism wrapper since each device will have scaling parameters for its respective features. This gives us the same result as if we had computed the statistics over the full feature size on a single device, and we can continue with the rest of the operations. Let's implement this norm class below."

We implemented the asynchronous communication patterns of gather and scatter, and applied them to a linear layer distributed over multiple devices. We then used these layers to implement an asynchronous MLP block, and trained a model with it. In the next notebook, we will discuss how to implement tensor parallelism in a transformer model. Furthermore, we will profile the model to show the efficiency of the async communication patterns in such models."

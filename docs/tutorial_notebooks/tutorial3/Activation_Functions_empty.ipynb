    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we have reviewed a set of six activation functions (sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, LeakyReLU, ELU, and Swish) in neural networks, and discussed how they influence the gradient distribution across layers. Sigmoid tends to fail deep neural networks as the highest gradient it provides is 0.25 leading to vanishing gradients in early layers. All ReLU-based activation functions have shown to perform well, and besides the original ReLU, do not have the issue of dead neurons. When implementing your own neural network, it is recommended to start with a ReLU-based network and select the specific activation function based on the properties of the network."
